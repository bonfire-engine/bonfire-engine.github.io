- [x] Multi TileLayer
- [x] Multi ObjectLayer
- [x] TileSet
- [x] Tile Animated
- [x] Load Map from URL
- [x] Text
- [x] Image Layer

Collision
   - [x] MultiCollision
   - [x] Retangle Collision
   - [x] Circle Collision
   - [x] Polygon Collision
   - [ ] Point Collision


## Using

Add the files generated by Tiled to the project by following the base: `assets/images/`

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/tiled/map.json
    - assets/images/tiled/tile_set.json
    - assets/images/tiled/img_tile_set.png
```

For maps built with Tiled we must use the Widget `BonfireWidget` (example [here](https://bonfire-engine.github.io/#/get-started?id=creating-your-map)):

```dart
  WorldMapByTiled map = WorldMapByTiled(
    'tiled/map.json', // main file path or url (example: http://rafaelbarbosatec.github.io/tiled/my_map.json)
    forceTileSize: DungeonMap.tileSize, // if you want to force the size of the Tile to be larger or smaller than the original
    objectsBuilder: {
        'goblin': (TiledObjectProperties properties) => Goblin(properties.position),
        'torch': (TiledObjectProperties properties) => Torch(properties.position),
        'barrel': (TiledObjectProperties properties) => BarrelDraggable(properties.position,),
    },
  );

  return BonfireWidget(
    joystick: Joystick(
      directional: JoystickDirectional()
    ),
    map: map,
    lightingColorGame: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
  );
```

## Tiled map example

If you want the Tile to be drawn above the player add type: `above` in your tileSet.

Result:

## Useful

You can set `class` in your tile to `above` to render this tile above all components in your game. 
If you need that the all tiles of layer render above all components you can create a `Custom Property` in your layer and create one named `class` with value `above`.

You can set `class` in your tile to `dynamicAbove` to render this tile dynamic by Y axis.

You can set `class` in your Object to `collision`. This object will be add in the game with transparency and collision.
You can set `class` in your ObjectLayer to `collision`. All objects of this layer will be add in the game with transparency and collision.
