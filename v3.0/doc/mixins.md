## Movement

Mixin responsible for adding movements.

Your component will gain properties like:

```dart
    double speed = 100;
    Direction lastDirection = Direction.right;
    Direction lastDirectionHorizontal = Direction.right;
    Direction lastDirectionVertical = Direction.down;
```

And methods to movement your component. (These movements take collisions into account. If returns `true` the movement was did with success)

```dart
    void moveUp({double? speed})
    void moveDown({double? speed})
    void moveLeft({double? speed})
    void moveRight({double? speed})
    void moveUpRight({double? speed})
    void moveUpLeft({double? speed})
    void moveDownLeft({double? speed})
    void moveDownRight({double? speed})
    void moveFromAngle({double? speed})
    void stopMove({bool forceIdle = false, bool isX = true, bool isY = true})
    void moveFromAngle(double angle, {double? speed})
    void moveFromDirection(Direction direction, {bool enabledDiagonal = true})
    bool moveToPosition(Vector2 position, {double? speed,bool useCenter = true})
```

You can listen the movement is changing:

```dart
@override
void onMove(
    double speed,
    Vector2 displacement,
    Direction direction,
    double angle,
  ) {}

```

## DirectionAnimation

> To use this mixin your component must contain `Movement` mixin.

Mixin responsible for adding animations to movements.

You need set a SimpleDirectionAnimation:

```dart
class MyComponent extends GameComponent with Movement, DirectionAnimation{
    MyComponent(){
        animation = SimpleDirectionAnimation();
    }
}
```

You can replace the `SimpleDirectionAnimation` using:

```dart

Future<void> replaceAnimation(
    SimpleDirectionAnimation newAnimation, {
    bool doIdle = true,
})

```

In the `SimpleDirectionAnimation` there are some methods util to control the animation:

```dart

/// Method used to play animation once time using `other` map
animation.playOnceOther()

/// Method used to play animation once time
animation.playOnce(
    FutureOr<SpriteAnimation> animation, {
    VoidCallback? onFinish,
    VoidCallback? onStart,
    bool runToTheEnd = false,
    bool flipX = false,
    bool flipY = false,
    bool useCompFlip = false,
    Vector2? size,
    Vector2? offset,
  );

/// Method used to play specific animation registred in `others`
animation.playOther(String key, {bool flipX = false, bool flipY = false});

/// Method used to register new animation in others
animation.addOtherAnimation(
    String key,
    FutureOr<SpriteAnimation> animation,
);

animation.pause();

animation.resume();

```

## MoveToPositionAlongThePath

> To use this mixin your component must contain `Movement` mixin.

Mixin responsible for find path using `a_star_algorithm` and moving the component through the path.

See [PathFinding](doc/path_finding)

## UseLifeBar

Mixin used to adds a BarLife to the attacable component

With this mixin you can configure the life bar view using the method `setupBarLife`:

```dart

void setupBarLife({
    Vector2? size,
    Color? backgroundColor,
    Color? borderColor,
    double borderWidth = 2,
    List<Color>? colors,
    BorderRadius? borderRadius,
    BarLifeDrawPorition barLifeDrawPosition = BarLifeDrawPorition.top,
    Vector2? offset,
    Vector2? textOffset,
    TextStyle? textStyle,
    bool showLifeText = true,
    BarLifeTextBuilder? barLifetextBuilder,
  })

```


## AutomaticRandomMovement

> To use this mixin your component must contain `Movement` mixin.

Mixin responsible for adding random movement like enemy walking through the scene.

To use just need add `runRandomMovement` method in your update:

```dart

class MyComponent extends GameComponent with Movement, AutomaticRandomMovement{
    
    @override
    void update(double dt) {
        this.runRandomMovement(dt);
        super.update(dt);
    }
}

```

All parameters:

```dart

void runRandomMovement(
    double dt, {
    bool runOnlyVisibleInCamera = true,
    double? speed,
    int maxDistance = 50,
    int minDistance = 25,

    /// milliseconds
    int timeKeepStopped = 2000,
    bool updateAngle = false,
    bool checkPositionWithRaycast = false,
    RandomMovementDirectionEnum direction = RandomMovementDirectionEnum.all,
    Function(Vector2 target)? onStartMove,
    Function()? onArrivedTarget,
  })

```

## MovementByJoystick

> To use this mixin your component must contain `Movement` and `JoystickListener` mixin.

Mixin responsible for adding movements through joystick events.

```dart
class MyComponent extends GameComponent with Movement, JoystickListener, MovementByJoystick{
    
}

```

That way if you add this component as a Joystick observer it will move when interacting with the joystick:

```dart

    MyComponent myComp = MyComponent();
    gameRef.joystickController?.addObserver(myComp);
    gameRef.camera.moveToTargetAnimated(myComp);

```

You can disable this behavior setting `movementByJoystickEnabled` false.

## Attackable

> how use it: `Player`, `Ally`, `Enemy`

Mixin responsible for adding damage-taking behavior to the component.

Your component will gain properties like:

```dart
    double maxLife;
    bool isDead;
    double life;
```

Adds these methods in your component:

```dart
    void initialLife(double life)
    void addLife(double life)
    void updateLife(double life,{bool verifyDieOrRevive = true})
    void removeLife(double life)

    /// This method is used to check if this component can receive damage from any attacker.
    @override
    bool checkCanReceiveDamage(
        AttackFromEnum attacker,
        double damage,
        dynamic from,
    )
    
    /// You can listen if this component receive attack
    @override
    void receiveDamage(double damage, dynamic from)

    /// If your life stay minor than 0 this method is called
    @override
    void die()
```

## Vision

Mixin responsible for adding vision to component. Components like `Player`, `Npc` and `Decoration` use this mixin.
Your component gain `seeComponent` and `seeComponentType` method.

Your can draw the component vision do this:

```dart
    setupVision(
        {
            Color? color,
            bool drawVision = false,
            int countPolygonPoints = 20,
        }
    );
```

When you use any method like `seeComponent` or `seeComponentType` will draw the vision.

## Sensor

Mixin responsible for adding trigger to detect other objects above.

See [Sensor](doc/sensor)

## Lighting

Mixin used to configure lighting in your component.

See [Lighting](doc/lighting)

## BlockMovementCollision

Mixin responsible for adding stop the movement when happen collision.

See [ObjectCollision](doc/collision_system)

## Pushable
> To use this mixin your component must contain `Movement` mixin.

Mixin responsible for enable push in the component.

You can do override the method `bool onPush(GameComponent component)` to control when can pushable. Returning true if the component is pushable, false otherwise. (default return true).

## Follower

This mixin do your component follow the position of the yout target.
Your component gain the properties: `followerTarget` and `followerOffset`.
You can configure your target like this:

```dart

setupFollower(target: myPLayer, offset: Vector2());

```

If a component that have this mixin is added as a child of other component. He will follow the parent position.


## UseAssetsLoader

Mixin used to load assets:

```dart
class MyComponent extends GameComponent with UseAssetsLoader{
    SpriteAnimation animation;
    MyComponent(Vector2 position,Future<SpriteAnimation> animIdle){
        this.position = position;
        loader?.add(AssetToLoad(animIdle, (value) {
            animation = value;
        }));
    }
}
```

## UseSpriteAnimation

Mixin that adds to your Component the use of the SpriteAnimation in easier way.
Your Component gains the `animation` property and `playSpriteAnimationOnce` method

```dart

class MyComponent extends GameComponent with UseSpriteAnimation{
    MyComponent(Vector2 position){
        this.position = position;
    }

    void playJump(){
        playSpriteAnimationOnce(MySpriteSheetLoader.getJumpAnimation());
    }

    @override
    Future onLoad() async {
        setAnimation(await MySpriteSheetLoader.geAnimation());
        return super.onLoad();
    }
}

```

You can know the current index animation or if is the last frame:

```dart
  bool get isAnimationLastFrame
  int get animationCurrentIndex
  int get isPaused
```

## UseSprite

Mixin that adds to your Component the use of the Sprite in easier way.
Your Component gains the `sprite`.

```dart

class MyComponent extends GameComponent with UseSprite{
    MyComponent(Vector2 position){
        this.position = position;
    }

    @override
    Future onLoad() async {
        sprite = await MySpriteSheetLoader.geSrite();
        return super.onLoad();
    }
}

```

### UseLifeBar

Mixin use to adds BarLife in a Attackable component.
With this mixin you can configure the life bar view using the method `setupLifeBar`:

```dart

void setupLifeBar({
    Vector2? size,
    Color? backgroundColor,
    Color? borderColor,
    double borderWidth = 2,
    double margin = 4,
    List<Color>? colors,
    BorderRadius? borderRadius,
    BarLifePorition barLifePosition = BarLifePorition.top,
    Vector2? offset,
    Vector2? textOffset,
    TextStyle? textStyle,
    bool showLifeText = true,
    BarLifeTextBuilder? barLifetextBuilder,
  })

```

### TileRecognizer

Mixin used to recognize the of tiles is below.

In the Tiled program used to build your map, you can set a `class` or set custom properties. With this mixin you can access this `Tile` information that the component is above.

```dart

/// Method that checks what type map tile is currently
 String? tileTypeBelow();
 /// Method that checks what types map tile is currently
 List<String> tileTypeListBelow()
 /// Method that checks what properties map tile is currently
 Map<String, dynamic>? tilePropertiesBelow()
 /// Method that checks what properties list map tile is currently
 List<Map<String, dynamic>>? tilePropertiesListBelow()
 /// Method that checks what map tiles is below
 Iterable<Tile> tileListBelow()

```

### BouncingObject

Mixin responsable to give the bounce behavior. (experimental). You can configure ir using the method `setupBouncingObject`.

```dart

void setupBouncingObject({
    bool enabled = true,
    double reflectFactor = 1.0,
  })

```
